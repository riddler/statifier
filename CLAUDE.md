# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Local Validation Workflow:**
When verifying code changes, always follow this sequence (also automated via pre-push git hook):

1. `mix format` - Auto-fix formatting issues (trailing whitespace, final newlines, etc.)
2. `mix test --cover` - Ensure functionality and maintain 95%+ test coverage  
3. `mix credo --strict` - Run static code analysis only after tests pass
4. `mix dialyzer` - Run Dialyzer static analysis for type checking

**Git Hooks:**

- `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` - Install pre-push hook for validation pipeline
- Pre-push hook automatically runs the validation workflow to catch issues before CI
- Located at `.git/hooks/pre-push` (executable)
- Blocks push if any validation step fails

**Regression Testing:**

- `test/passing_tests.json` - Registry of tests that should always pass
- Tracks internal tests, SCION tests, and W3C tests separately
- Updated manually when new tests start passing consistently
- Used by CI pipeline to catch regressions early

**Testing:**

- `mix test` - Run all internal tests (excludes SCION/W3C by default) - 444 tests
- `mix test --include scion --include scxml_w3` - Run all tests including SCION and W3C tests
- `mix test.regression` - Run regression tests that should always pass - 63 tests (critical functionality)
- `mix test.baseline` - Check which tests are currently passing (for updating regression suite)
- `mix test --cover` - Run all tests with coverage reporting (maintain 90%+ coverage - currently 92.3%)
- `mix coveralls` - Alternative coverage command
- `mix coveralls.detail` - Run tests with detailed coverage report showing uncovered lines
- `mix test test/statifier/location_test.exs` - Run location tracking tests
- `mix test test/statifier/parser/scxml_test.exs` - Run specific SCXML parser tests (uses pattern matching)
- `mix test test/statifier/interpreter/compound_state_test.exs` - Run compound state tests
- `mix test test/statifier/interpreter/eventless_transitions_test.exs` - Run eventless transition tests

**Development:**

- `mix deps.get` - Install dependencies
- `mix compile` - Compile the project
- `mix docs` - Generate documentation
- `mix format` - Format code according to Elixir standards (run first for code verification)
- `mix format --check-formatted` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `mix credo --strict` - Run static code analysis with strict mode (run after tests pass)
- `mix dialyzer` - Run Dialyzer for static type analysis (run last in verification workflow)

## Architecture

This is an Elixir implementation of SCXML (State Chart XML) state machines with a focus on W3C compliance.

The State Chart reference XML is here: <https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/>

This project uses Elixir Structs for the data structures, and MapSets for sets.

Also use this initial Elixir implementation as reference: <https://github.com/camshaft/ex_statechart>

## Core Components

### Data Structures

- **`SC.Document`** - Root SCXML document structure with:
  - Attributes: `name`, `initial`, `datamodel`, `version`, `xmlns`
  - Collections: `states`, `datamodel_elements`  
  - O(1) Lookup maps: `state_lookup` (id → state), `transitions_by_source` (id → [transitions])
  - Built via `Document.build_lookup_maps/1` during validation phase
- **`SC.State`** - Individual state with `id`, optional `initial` state, nested `states` list, and `transitions` list
- **`SC.Transition`** - State transitions with optional `event`, `target`, and `cond` attributes
- **`SC.DataElement`** - Datamodel elements with required `id` and optional `expr` and `src` attributes

### Parsers (Parse Phase)

- **`SC.Parser.SCXML`** - Main SCXML parser using Saxy SAX parser for accurate location tracking
  - Parses XML strings into `SC.Document` structs with precise source location information
  - Event-driven SAX parsing for better memory efficiency and location tracking
  - Handles namespace declarations and XML attributes correctly
  - Supports nested states and hierarchical structures
  - Converts empty XML attributes to `nil` for cleaner data representation
  - Returns `{:ok, document}` or `{:error, reason}` tuples
  - **Pure parsing only** - does not build optimization structures
- **`SC.Parser.SCXML.Handler`** - SAX event handler for SCXML parsing
  - Implements `Saxy.Handler` behavior for processing XML events
  - Tracks element occurrences and position information during parsing
  - Manages element stack for proper hierarchical document construction
- **`SC.Parser.SCXML.ElementBuilder`** - Builds SCXML elements from SAX events
- **`SC.Parser.SCXML.LocationTracker`** - Tracks precise source locations for elements and attributes
- **`SC.Parser.SCXML.StateStack`** - Manages parsing state stack for hierarchical document construction

### Validation and Optimization (Validate + Optimize Phases)

- **`SC.Validator`** - Main validation orchestrator
  - **Modular architecture**: Split into focused sub-validators for maintainability
  - **Validation**: Structural correctness, semantic consistency, reference validation
  - **Optimization**: Builds O(1) lookup maps via `finalize/2` for valid documents only
  - Returns `{:ok, optimized_document, warnings}` or `{:error, errors, warnings}`
  - **Clean architecture**: Only optimizes documents that pass validation
- **`SC.Validator.StateValidator`** - State ID uniqueness and validation
- **`SC.Validator.TransitionValidator`** - Transition target validation
- **`SC.Validator.InitialStateValidator`** - All initial state constraints (attributes, elements, conflicts)
- **`SC.Validator.ReachabilityAnalyzer`** - State reachability graph analysis  
- **`SC.Validator.Utils`** - Shared utilities across validators

### Interpreter and Runtime  

- **`SC.Interpreter`** - Core SCXML interpreter with W3C-compliant processing model
  - **Microstep/Macrostep Execution**: Implements SCXML event processing model where microsteps (single transition set execution) are processed until stable macrostep completion
  - **Exit Set Computation**: Uses W3C SCXML exit set calculation algorithm for determining which states to exit during transitions
  - **LCCA Algorithm**: Full Least Common Compound Ancestor computation for accurate transition conflict resolution and exit set calculation
  - **Eventless Transitions**: Automatic transitions without event attributes (also called NULL transitions in SCXML spec)
  - **Optimal Transition Set**: SCXML-compliant transition conflict resolution where child state transitions take priority over ancestors
  - **Compound state support**: Automatically enters initial child states recursively
  - **Parallel state support**: Proper concurrent execution with cross-boundary exit semantics and parallel region preservation
  - **Conditional transitions**: Full `cond` attribute support with Predicator v3.0 expression evaluation and SCXML `In()` function
  - **Assign action support**: Complete `<assign>` element execution with data model integration
  - **Cycle Detection**: Prevents infinite loops in eventless transitions with configurable iteration limits (100 iterations default)
  - **O(1 lookups**: Uses `Document.find_state/2` and `Document.get_transitions_from_state/2`
  - Separates `active_states()` (leaf only) from `active_ancestors()` (includes parents)
  - Provides `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` responses
- **`SC.StateChart`** - Runtime container for SCXML state machines
  - Combines document, configuration, event queues, and data model
  - Maintains internal and external event queues per SCXML specification
  - **Data model storage**: Persistent variable storage with `data_model` field
  - **Current event context**: Tracks current event for expression evaluation
- **`SC.Configuration`** - Active state configuration management
  - Stores only leaf states for efficient memory usage
  - Computes ancestor states dynamically via `active_ancestors/2` using O(1) document lookups
  - Uses MapSets for fast state membership testing
  - Optimized MapSet operations (direct construction vs incremental building)
- **`SC.Event`** - Event representation with internal/external origins
  - Supports event data and origin tracking
  - Used for state machine event processing

### Expression Evaluation and Data Model

- **`SC.ValueEvaluator`** - Comprehensive value evaluation system for SCXML expressions
  - **Expression compilation**: `compile_expression/1` for reusable predicator compilation
  - **Value evaluation**: `evaluate_value/2` extracts actual values (not just boolean results)
  - **Location path resolution**: `resolve_location/1,2` validates assignment paths using predicator v3.0's `context_location`
  - **Safe assignment operations**: `assign_value/3` performs type-safe nested data model updates
  - **Integrated assignment**: `evaluate_and_assign/3` combines evaluation and assignment
  - **SCXML context support**: Full integration with state machine context (events, configuration, datamodel)
  - **Nested property access**: Support for deep property access (`user.profile.settings.theme`)
  - **Mixed access patterns**: Combined bracket/dot notation (`users['john'].active`)
  - **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **`SC.ConditionEvaluator`** - Enhanced with predicator v3.0 integration
  - **Predicator v3.0**: Upgraded from v2.0 with enhanced nested property access capabilities
  - **SCXML functions**: Maintains `In()` function and SCXML-specific context building
  - **Type-safe operations**: Improved type coercion and graceful fallback for missing properties

### Actions and Executable Content

- **`SC.Actions.AssignAction`** - SCXML `<assign>` element implementation
  - **Location-based assignment**: Validates assignment paths using SC.ValueEvaluator
  - **Expression evaluation**: Uses SC.ValueEvaluator for complex expression processing
  - **Nested property assignment**: Supports deep assignment (`user.profile.name = "John"`)
  - **Mixed notation support**: Handles both dot and bracket notation in assignments
  - **Context integration**: Access to current event data and state configuration
  - **Error recovery**: Graceful error handling with logging, continues execution on failures
- **`SC.Actions.LogAction`** - SCXML `<log>` element implementation for debugging
- **`SC.Actions.RaiseAction`** - SCXML `<raise>` element implementation for internal events
- **`SC.Actions.ActionExecutor`** - Centralized action execution system
  - **Phase tracking**: Executes actions during appropriate state entry/exit phases
  - **Mixed action support**: Handles log, raise, assign, and future action types
  - **StateChart integration**: Actions can modify state chart data model and event queues

### Architecture Flow

The implementation follows a clean **Parse → Validate → Optimize** architecture:

```elixir
# 1. Parse Phase: XML → Document structure
{:ok, document} = SC.Parser.SCXML.parse(xml_string)

# 2. Validate + Optimize Phase: Check semantics + build lookup maps
{:ok, optimized_document, warnings} = SC.Validator.validate(document)

# 3. Interpret Phase: Use optimized document for runtime
{:ok, state_chart} = SC.Interpreter.initialize(optimized_document)
```

**Benefits:**

- Parsers focus purely on structure (supports future JSON/YAML parsers)
- Validation catches semantic errors before optimization
- Only valid documents get expensive optimization treatment
- Clear separation of concerns across phases

### Feature Detection and Test Infrastructure

- **`SC.FeatureDetector`** - Detects SCXML features used in documents
  - Enables proper test validation by failing tests that depend on unsupported features
  - Prevents false positive test results from unsupported feature usage
  - Supports both XML string and parsed document analysis
  - Tracks feature support status (`:supported`, `:unsupported`, `:partial`)
- **`SC.Case`** - Test case template module for SCXML testing
  - Provides `test_scxml/4` function for testing state machine behavior
  - Uses SC.Interpreter for document initialization and event processing
  - Supports initial configuration verification and event sequence testing
  - Used by both SCION and W3C test suites

### Location Tracking

All parsed SCXML elements include precise source location information for validation error reporting:

- **Element locations**: Each parsed element (`SC.Document`, `SC.State`, `SC.Transition`, `SC.DataElement`) includes a `source_location` field with line/column information
- **Attribute locations**: Individual attributes have dedicated location fields (e.g., `name_location`, `id_location`, `event_location`) for precise error reporting
- **Multiline support**: Accurately tracks locations for both single-line and multiline XML element definitions
- **SAX-based tracking**: Uses Saxy's event-driven parsing to maintain position information throughout the parsing process

## Dependencies

- **`predicator`** (~> 3.0) - Safe condition and value evaluator with enhanced nested property access
- **`saxy`** (~> 1.6) - Fast, memory-efficient SAX XML parser with position tracking support

## Development Dependencies

- **`credo`** (~> 1.7) - Static code analysis tool for code quality and consistency
- **`dialyxir`** (~> 1.4) - Dialyzer wrapper for static type analysis and error detection

## XML Format

Test files use triple-quote multiline strings for XML content:

```elixir
xml = """
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0" initial="a">
    <state id="a"/>
</scxml>
"""
```

XML content within triple quotes uses 4-space base indentation.
