## What is Statifier?

Statifier is an Elixir implementation of **SCXML (State Chart XML)** state machines with a focus on W3C compliance. It provides a complete runtime engine for executing complex state charts with hierarchical states, parallel execution, and advanced features like history states and conditional transitions.

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Complete SCXML Implementation

- **Hierarchical States**: Nested states with automatic initial child entry
- **Parallel States**: Concurrent state regions with proper exit semantics  
- **History States**: Shallow and deep history state support per W3C specification
- **Conditional Transitions**: Full expression evaluation with SCXML `In()` function
- **Executable Content**: Complete `<assign>`, `<if>`, `<log>`, and `<raise>` element support

### ‚úÖ High Performance Design

- **O(1 Lookups**: Optimized state and transition maps for fast execution
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Stores only leaf states with dynamic ancestor computation
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents infinite loops in eventless transitions
- **Optimized Parsing**: SAX-based XML parsing with precise location tracking

### ‚úÖ Production Ready

- **Comprehensive Testing**: 707 internal tests with 92.3% code coverage
- **Regression Protection**: 118 critical functionality tests prevent regressions
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-push validation workflow catches issues early
- **Clean Code**: Full Credo compliance with proper documentation

## Quick Example

```elixir
# Parse SCXML document
xml = """
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0" initial="idle">
  <state id="idle">
    <transition event="start" target="running"/>
  </state>
  <state id="running">
    <transition event="stop" target="idle"/>
  </state>
</scxml>
"""

# Initialize state chart
{:ok, document, _warnings} = Statifier.parse(xml)
{:ok, state_chart} = Statifier.initialize(document)

# Process events
{:ok, new_state_chart} = Statifier.send_sync(state_chart, "start")
```

## Installation

Add `statifier` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
