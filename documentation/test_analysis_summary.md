# SCXML Test Suite Analysis Summary

## Current Status

- **Total Tests**: 444 (SCION + W3C test suites)
- **Passing**: 294 (66.2%)
- **Failing**: 150 (33.8%)
- **Missing Features**: 13 unique SCXML features

## Feature Analysis Results

### Top Missing Features by Test Impact

1. **onentry_actions**: 78 tests blocked - Actions executed when entering states
2. **log_elements**: 72 tests blocked - Logging within executable content  
3. **data_elements**: 64 tests blocked - Variable declarations in datamodel
4. **datamodel**: 64 tests blocked - Data model container element
5. **assign_elements**: 48 tests blocked - Variable assignments
6. **raise_elements**: 48 tests blocked - Internal event generation
7. **send_elements**: 34 tests blocked - Event sending (internal/external)
8. **onexit_actions**: 21 tests blocked - Actions executed when exiting states
9. **history_states**: 12 tests blocked - State history preservation
10. **targetless_transitions**: 10 tests blocked - Action-only transitions

### Core Insights

**Executable Content is Critical**: The top failing feature categories (onentry/onexit actions, logging, raise events) represent the foundation of SCXML's executable content model. Without these, most real-world statecharts cannot function.

**Data Model is Complex**: Data model features (datamodel, data_elements, assign_elements) require implementing JavaScript expression evaluation, which is architecturally significant.

**Parser Limitations**: Current parser only handles structural elements (states, transitions) but skips all executable content elements, treating them as "unknown."

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High ROI)**: Basic executable content support

- Target: onentry_actions, log_elements, raise_elements, onexit_actions
- Expected unlock: ~120+ additional tests (30% improvement)
- Complexity: Medium (2-3 weeks)

**Phase 2 (Full Compliance)**: Data model implementation  

- Target: datamodel, data_elements, assign_elements
- Expected unlock: ~100+ additional tests (25% improvement)
- Complexity: High (4-6 weeks)

**Phase 3 (Polish)**: Advanced features

- Target: history_states, send_elements, internal_transitions
- Expected unlock: ~30+ remaining tests (7% improvement)  
- Complexity: Medium (2-3 weeks)

## Technical Requirements

### Parser Extensions Needed

Current parser must be extended to handle:

```xml
<onentry>
  <log expr="'entering state'" />
  <raise event="internal_event" />
</onentry>

<transition event="go" target="next">
  <assign location="counter" expr="counter + 1" />
</transition>
```

### Interpreter Enhancements Needed  

Current interpreter must execute actions during transitions:

1. Execute onexit actions of exiting states
2. Execute transition actions  
3. Execute onentry actions of entering states
4. Process raised internal events in microsteps

### Architecture Changes Required

- **New data structures**: Action lists in states/transitions
- **New modules**: ActionExecutor, ExpressionEvaluator, DataModel
- **Enhanced execution**: Action integration in transition processing

## Example Test Case Analysis

**Simple Raise Event Test** (`send1_test.exs`):

```xml
<state id="a">
    <transition target="b" event="t">
        <raise event="s"/>
    </transition>
</state>
<state id="b">  
    <transition target="c" event="s"/>
</state>
```

**Expected Behavior**:

1. Send event "t" → transition a→b
2. Execute raise action → generate internal "s" event  
3. Process "s" event → transition b→c
4. Final state: "c"

**Current Result**: Test blocked due to unsupported `raise_elements`

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Implement basic executable content support to unlock 30% more tests with moderate effort

2. **Focus on `raise` elements first**: Many failing tests depend on internal event generation, which is conceptually simple but architecturally important

3. **Use SCION tests for validation**: SCION tests provide excellent isolated examples of each feature in action

4. **Delay data model complexity**: While data model unlocks many tests, it requires significant architectural investment. Basic executable content provides better ROI.

5. **Maintain test-driven approach**: The comprehensive test suite provides excellent validation for each implementation step
