# W3C Test Improvement Plan

## Current Status

**Test Pass Rate:** 22/59 W3C tests passing (37.3%)  
**Recent Improvement:** Fixed multi-state initial configuration parsing - test576 and test413 now pass  
**Baseline:** Up from 20/59 (34%) before the multi-state initial fix

## High-Impact Quick Wins (Estimated 2-4 weeks)

**Target Tests:** test277, test276sub1, test550, test551 (data manipulation tests)

### 2. Improved Event Processing  

**Impact:** ~6-8 additional tests  
**Effort:** Medium

- **Missing Features:**
  - Enhanced event queuing semantics
  - Proper event data handling and propagation
  - Cross-state event communication improvements

**Target Tests:** test399, test401, test402 (event processing tests)

  - Enhanced transition conflict resolution
  - Improved parallel state semantics

**Target Tests:** test406, test412, test416, test419, test423 (transition selection tests)

## Medium-Term Improvements (4-8 weeks)

  - `<script>` element execution
  - Advanced `<foreach>` iteration constructs

**Target Tests:** test155, test156, test525 (foreach tests), various send/script tests

### 5. Advanced History State Features

**Impact:** ~3-4 additional tests  
**Effort:** Medium

- **Missing Features:**
  - Complex history restoration scenarios
  - History state default transition improvements
  - Deep vs shallow history edge cases

**Target Tests:** test388, test579, test580 (advanced history tests)

### 6. Final State Handling

**Impact:** ~2-3 additional tests  
**Effort:** Low-Medium

- **Missing Features:**
  - Enhanced final state semantics
  - Proper final state event generation
  - Final state hierarchy handling

**Target Tests:** test570 (final state tests)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement (Priority 1)

1. **Parser Updates:** Enhance `<data>` element parsing with expression evaluation
2. **Runtime Storage:** Improve datamodel variable storage and initialization
3. **Expression Engine:** Integrate enhanced JavaScript-style expression evaluation
4. **Test Integration:** Update test infrastructure to handle data-driven scenarios

### Phase 2: Event Processing Improvements (Priority 2)  

1. **Event Queue Semantics:** Implement proper internal/external event queuing per SCXML spec
2. **Event Data Propagation:** Ensure event data is properly passed and accessible
3. **Cross-State Communication:** Improve event handling between parallel regions
4. **Validation Updates:** Enhance event-related validation rules

### Phase 3: Advanced State Machine Features (Priority 3)

1. **Targetless Transitions:** Implement internal transitions without target states  
2. **Transition Conflict Resolution:** Enhance SCXML-compliant transition selection
3. **Parallel State Semantics:** Improve concurrent execution and exit handling
4. **Optimization:** Maintain O(1) lookup performance for advanced features

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1 Target:** 30+ tests passing (51% pass rate)
- **Phase 2 Target:** 36+ tests passing (61% pass rate)
- **Phase 3 Target:** 42+ tests passing (71% pass rate)
- **Ultimate Goal:** 50+ tests passing (85% pass rate)

## Technical Approach

### Maintain Architecture Principles

- **Parse → Validate → Optimize** workflow
- **O(1) lookup optimizations** for performance
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for regressions
- **SCXML specification compliance** over custom extensions

### Development Workflow

1. **Analyze failing tests** to identify specific missing features
2. **Implement core functionality** with proper validation
3. **Update test expectations** and fix any regressions
4. **Run full test suite** to ensure no breaking changes
5. **Measure improvement** against W3C test pass rate

## Current Blockers Analysis

### Most Common Test Failure Patterns

1. **Data model operations** - Missing variable initialization and manipulation
2. **Event handling** - Incomplete event queuing and processing semantics  
3. **Transition selection** - Advanced SCXML transition conflict resolution
4. **Executable content** - Missing `<send>`, `<script>`, and `<foreach>` support

### Technical Debt to Address

- Some tests create invalid document structures (fixed in multi-state work)
- Expression evaluation needs JavaScript compatibility improvements
- Event queuing semantics need W3C SCXML compliance review

## Next Steps

1. **Start with data model enhancement** - highest impact, medium effort
2. **Create feature branch** for data model work  
3. **Implement `<data>` element initialization** with expression evaluation
4. **Update failing data-related tests** (test277, test276sub1, etc.)
5. **Measure improvement** and proceed to event processing phase
